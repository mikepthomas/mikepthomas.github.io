# Building a DIY Eurorack Modular Synth

Updated July 9, 2023

I am a fan of [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.youtube.com/@LOOKMUMNOCOMPUTER), In one of his videos he mentioned about the website [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&VPW=1430&VPH=660) and the book `Make: Analog Synthesizers` which I have brought and I am currently reading through.
