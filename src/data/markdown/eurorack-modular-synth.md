# Building a DIY Eurorack Modular Synth

June 29, 2023 by [Mike Thomas](https://github.com/mikepthomas)

I am a fan of [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.youtube.com/@LOOKMUMNOCOMPUTER), In one of his videos he mentioned about the website [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&VPW=1430&VPH=660) and the book `Make: Analog Synthesizers` which I have brought and I am currently reading through.
