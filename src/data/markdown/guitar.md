## Assembly

Assembly of the guitar is split into the following parts:

1. [Sourcing Parts](#sourcing-parts)
2. [Attaching Neck](#attaching-neck)
3. [Main Body](#main-body)
4. [Attaching Sides](#attaching-sides)
5. [Finishing Up](#finishing-up)

### Sourcing Parts

All the parts required to assemble the guitar have been purchased from Amazon. They were the cheapest parts I could find that fit the aesthetic I was going for.

### Attaching Neck

The parts were printed using a 1mm nozzle on my Anet A8 3D Printer. This is the only time I have used a nozzle different to the standard 0.4mm nozzle. I chose a larger nozzle to both print the parts faster but also ensure the parts come out strong.

I designed the Tremolo cover in SketchUp 2017 and it is [available on my 3D printing GitHub repository](https://github.com/mikepthomas/3dprinting/blob/main/Designs/Guitar%20Tremolo%20Cover/Tremolo%20Cover.stl).
