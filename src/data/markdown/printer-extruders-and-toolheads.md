## Anet A8 MK8

This is the [Stock hotend and extruder that came with the Anet A8](printer.md#x-axis) I have replaced all of the hotend parts, the heater block, heater cartridge, thermistor and heat break and have added a heater block sock. I have also added a few [3D printed quality of life upgrades](printer-printed-upgrades.md#extruder-upgrades).

## ANET A8 BMG Direct Drive

I have purchased parts to install the [ANET A8 E3DV6 BMG Direct Drive X Carriage](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3807114), the adapter plate should be a direct bolt on to the X Carriage of the Anet A8. This was chosen as the parts that are required for this are the exact same parts that are required to build the [Voron Afterburner](#voron-afterburner-stealthburner).

## Voron M4

When I have upgraded to the Afterburner, I will reuse the parts for the M4 for the [Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder](printer-enraged-rabbit-carrot-feeder.md).

## Voron Afterburner/Stealthburner

I will print either the parts in the [Voron Afterburner Repository](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner) or go directly to the [Stealthburner](https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner) if it is released before I get to printing the toolhead (It is currently in Beta at the time of writing).

There is also an adapter plate, [Hypercube Afterburner adapter intergration remix](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5156654) that may work to mount the Afterburner on the Anet A8 guide rails.
