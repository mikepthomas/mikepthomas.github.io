This project was to take a cheap 3D printer and make it better by upgrading components and 3D printing
improved parts.

### Semi-Circular Anet A8 Fan Duct

This was a required upgrade as the original Anet A8 fan duct started to melt.

This didn't stiffen up the frame as much as I would like... to improve print quality, it was replaced by the [Hulk Frame Brace for the Anet A8](#hulk-frame-brace-for-the-anet-a8)

### Anet A8 Electronics Case

This electronics case was chosen as it could house 2 [Mosfets](#safety-upgrades), one for the heated bed and one for the hotend.

The case, once installed really tidied up the printer's wires and made it easier to move around.
