# OpenRC F1 Project
How I printed my OpenRC F1 car, Designed by Daniel Norée.

## 3D Printing a radio controlled car
August 5, 2018 by [Mike Thomas](https://github.com/mikepthomas)

This project was one of the main reasons I got into 3D printing in the first place.
Ever since getting my Anet A8 3D printer, I've wanted to build this.
