# Anet A8 3D Printer

Assembly of an Anet A8 3D printer.

## 3D Printing modifications for a 3D printer

May 19, 2018 by [Mike Thomas](https://github.com/mikepthomas)

This project was to take a cheap 3D printer and make it better by upgrading components and 3D printing
improved parts.

## Safety Upgrades

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/safety-upgrades.jpg)

The Anet A8 has a bit of a [reputation for catching on fire](https://www.fabbaloo.com/2018/12/3d-printer-safety-another-anet-a8-burns) these upgrades are a must to ensure safety of using the printer.

- 30A power supply
- Mosfets
- Enable Thermal runaway in Marlin

## Auto Bed Levelling

To enable auto bed levelling on the printer I used a Tronxy XY-08N.

The firmware to enable the sensor is available on [my Marlin Github repository](https://github.com/mikepthomas/Marlin/tree/2.0.x-Anet3D-V1-5)

## 3D Printed Upgrades

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/printed-items.jpg)

Some 3D printed upgrades that I have made to allow he printer to print and look better.

1. [Semi-Circular Anet A8 Fan Duct](#semi-circular-anet-a8-fan-duct)
2. [Anet A8 T corner](#anet-a8-t-corner)
3. [Hulk Frame Brace for the Anet A8](#hulk-frame-brace-for-the-anet-a8)
4. [Anet A8 Electronics Case](#anet-a8-electronics-case)

### Semi-Circular Anet A8 Fan Duct

[Fan duct from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1954001) by user [lokster](https://www.thingiverse.com/lokster)

This was a required upgrade as the original Anet A8 fan duct started to melt.

### Anet A8 T corner

![Anet A8 T corner installed](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/t-corner-installed.jpg)

This didn't stiffen up the frame as much as I would like... to improve print quality, it was replaced by the [Hulk Frame Brace for the Anet A8](#hulk-frame-brace-for-the-anet-a8)

### Anet A8 Electronics Case

[Electronics Case from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2670756) by user [FqFKrazz](https://www.thingiverse.com/FqFKrazz)

![Anet A8 Electronics Case](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/electronics-case.jpg)

![Anet A8 Electronics Case Mosfet](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/mosfet.jpg)

This electronics case was chosen as it could house 2 [Mosfets](#safety-upgrades), one for the heated bed and one for the hotend.

![Anet A8 Electronics Case Before](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/electronics-case-before.jpg)

![Anet A8 Electronics Case After](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/electronics-case-after.jpg)

The case, once installed really tidied up the printer's wires and made it easier to move around.
