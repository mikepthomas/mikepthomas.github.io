# Creating a solar powered weather station

June 27, 2023 by [Mike Thomas](https://github.com/mikepthomas)

I won an auction titled "`Box of bits inc Arduinos, Pi's, Odroid, various sensors etc`" on ebay there were 3 PCBs and a few other required components included in the lot, let's order the rest of the parts and assemble them.

## What is this?

This is a PCB to create a [Weather Station powered by an 18650 battery](https://www.instructables.com/Solar-Powered-WiFi-Weather-Station-V20), the project has had a few updates at the time of writing, the project is up to V4.0, however most of the parts required were included in the original listing so why not try assemble them and see how it goes.

## Printed Circuit Board

The PCB was designed by [Open Green Energy](https://www.instructables.com/member/opengreenenergy) and was designed around the [Wemos D1 Mini Pro](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini_pro.html) micro controller, and it includes a connector to attach a solar panel, a TP4056 to charge an 18650 Lithium battery, and a BMP280 Temperature, Humidity and Barometric Pressure sensor. It also has a few extra headers for attaching additional sensors such as a DS18B20 Temperature sensor or adding an I2C display.

## Parts Required

Quantities are for 1 PCB.
